FINDING THE NUMBER OF HOUSES IN A  IMAGE
. made a own dataset containing images of households
. used roboflow application to make house detection model by  a object detection model by manually shwoing which type of object(buildings) need to be detected by the model
. then trained the model
. installed ultralytics roboflow in collab then provied the api key to the collab so that we can acess the building detection model
.wrote a code which takes the image from dataset as input (ex:001.jpg) and gives output as image file name containing {name of old file}_Houses_{house_count}(ex:V001_Houses_0.jpg) .
.which means for a file name 001.jpg the model detected 0 houses .
